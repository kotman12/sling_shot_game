This repoitory is just a simple game I built using only javascript and jquery. The game can only be run on Google Chrome!

It is not hosted anywhere as of now so if you want to play it then just download the index.html file or copy the code and run it locally on your browser.

Kudos to MIT for jQuery and W3 for a pretty neat tutorial on game creation in js which helped quite a bit at the beginning stages.

Happy Playing!
