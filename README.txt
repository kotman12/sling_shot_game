This repository is just a simple game I built using only javascript+jquery. You should run it on Chrome preferably as it is pretty slow on IE.

It is not hosted anywhere as of now so if you want to play it then just download the index.html file and run it locally on your browser.

Kudos to W3 for a pretty neat tutorial on game creation in js which helped quite a bit at the beginning stages.
